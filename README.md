## [Play the game here!](https://diego-escalante.itch.io/duck-dodge)
This game was made in 48 hours for the GMTK Game Jam in July 2023. The theme of the jam was "Roles Reversed." It was made with Godot 4.1 using GDScript.

## Setting Up the Project Locally
1. Make sure you have [Godot 3.1](https://godotengine.org/download) installed, as that is the version of the engine that was used for this game. No need to get the .NET version of Godot, as this project purely uses GDScript.
2. Clone this repo in your desired directory: `git clone https://github.com/diego-escalante/GMTK2023-DuckDodge.git`
3. Start up Godot. In the initial Project Manager window, click Import and choose the `project.godot` file at the root of your cloned repo.
4. Once the engine opens up the project, you can run the game by using the Play buttons on the top right.

## Other Notes
* The project has an [MIT license](LICENSE). Feel free to inspect the game, tinker with it, and learn from it. Let me know if you do something cool with it! Cheers!
